## Assignment 1

### Train a model using the FastAI Python library that can classify images within predefined categories

I decided to use the food41 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41) which contains labelled images of 100 different foods. I was able to get the model to classify new images (within those 100 categories) to 75% accuracy. In order to run the notebook locally, you need to download the dataset locally and place it within the projects/project-1 directory.
