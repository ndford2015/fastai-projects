## Assignment 1

### Train a model using the FastAI Python library that can classify images within predefined categories

I decided to use the food41 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41) which contains labelled images of 100 different foods. I was able to get the model to classify new images (within those 100 categories) to 75% accuracy. In order to run the notebook locally, you need to download the dataset locally and place it within the projects/project-1 directory. 

## Assignment 2

### Put your model in production!

I made a small web-app that takes a url specifying an image of 1 of the 100 categories of foods listed in project 1 and tells you the probability of it being a certain category

## Assignment 3

### Work on a project that involves creating data bunches, training a model, and testing the results

I decided to continue a personal project of using NLP to classify the words in ingredient listings (in recipes). My goal is achieve an accuracy of classifying the words in an ingredient to 95%. For example the phrase "1 cup of chopped garlic" would classify to "amount unit comment comment name".
